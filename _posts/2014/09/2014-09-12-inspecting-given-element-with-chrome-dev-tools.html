<p>Inspecting a particular element in web browsers is one of most frequent task of front-end developers. By doing that, we then can adjust its styles, drag and drop it to desired position, and various tasks.</p>
<p>Sometime, we need to access the element instance in Console, for example, to call a jQuery plugin method. It can be done easily if the element can be queried via a simple CSS selector.</p>
<p>The question is <strong>How to do that if the element is just a general one in page?</strong></p>

<p>Fortunately, <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools">Chrome Developer Tools</a> provides the ability of accessing selected element in simple steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right click the element, and choose <strong>Inspect Element</strong> from the context menu</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Console</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Then you can retrieve the element instance as $0</li>
</ul>
<p>After that, if the page uses <a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>, you can call any jQuery methods to manipulate the DOM element.</p>

<p>The following video demonstrates this process:</p>
<video class="video-js vjs-default-skin vjs-big-play-centered"
    controls
    preload="auto"
    width="740"
    height="600"
    data-setup="{}"
    poster="https://s3.amazonaws.com/programertips/2014/09/inspecting-given-element.png">
    <source src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/programertips/2014/09/inspecting-given-element.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<p>As seen in the video, $0 is the selected element, and $($0) is the jQuery object representing the element.</p>
<p>If jQuery is not available on page, then</p>
<ul>
    <li>$() is equivalent to <code>document.querySelector()</code> which returns the first element that matches the passed CSS selector.</li>
    <li>$$() returns an array of all matching elements, which is the same as what <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> returns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only the last selected element, Chrome Developer Tools also remembers the last five inspected one, and make them accessible in Console as $0, $1, $2, $3 and $4. The most recently selected element is $0, the second most is $1, and so forth.</p>

<h3>Opening element from the Console</h3>
<p>In the reverse direction, you can inspect the element from the Console by either right-clicking the output of $0, and choosing <strong>Reveal in Elements panel</strong>, or using the command <code>inspect($0)</code>:</p>

<p class="text-center">
    <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/programertips/2014/09/reveal-element.png" />
</p>

<p>The element is then opened in the <strong>Elements</strong> panel.</p>

<h3>What about Firefox?</h3>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox Developer Tools</a> also provides the same capability, but it's only possible to access the last selected element as $0.</p>
<p>$(), $$() and inspect() <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console#Helper_commands">helpers</a> are the same as Chrome Developer Tools.</p>
