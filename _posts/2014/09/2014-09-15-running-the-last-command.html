<p>When working with the Terminal, you might know to use the <kbd>top arrow</kbd> key to switch to the previous command.</p>
<p>The following command does the same thing:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">!!</code></pre>

<p>It's very useful when you need to run the previous command which asks for administrator privilege, as seen in the image below:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">sudo !!</code></pre>
