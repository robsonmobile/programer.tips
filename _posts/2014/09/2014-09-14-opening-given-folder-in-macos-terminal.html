<p>No matter who you are, a developer, database administrator or system engineer, Terminal might be one of the tools you've been working with most.</p>
<p>For example, to the front-end developers, we usually need to run the building <a href="http://gruntjs.com">GruntJS</a> or <a href="http://gulpjs.com">GulpJS</a> scripts, start an <a href="http://expressjs.com">ExpressJS</a> application right from the Terminal.</p>
<p>These tasks have a common starting point which is to be executed from given directory.</p>

<p>Today, I will show you two quick ways to open particular directory in the MacOS Terminal without using any additional software, scripts or workflow.</p>

<h3>Adding the New Termnial at Folder menu</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Open the <strong>System Preferences</strong></li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Keyboard</strong>, and choose the <strong>Shortcuts</strong> tab</li>
    <li>Choose <strong>Services</strong> from the left, and then enable the <strong>New Terminal at Folder</strong> option from the right</li>
</ul>

<p>You also can click <strong>add shortcut</strong> button to define the shortcut.</p>

</p>

<p>From now on, in order to open a folder in Terminal, just right-click the folder, and choose <strong>Service</strong> &rarr; <strong>New Terminal at Folder</strong> from the context menu.</p>

<h3>Dragging the folder into the Terminal</h3>
<p>This way is more convenient than the first one. Just hold down the <kbd>command</kbd> key and drag the folder into the Terminal. That's all. How easy it is!</p>

<p>By doing this, you don't even to worry if the path to folder consists of spaces. The system automatically add \ characters to quote the path for you.</p>
<p>For instance, dragging <code>/Library/Application Support/App Store</code> into the Terminal will execute the command:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd /Library/Application\ Support/App\ Store</code></pre>

<h3>What about Windows?</h3>
<p>On Windows, the job can be done easily by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key, right-click the folder, and choose <strong>Open command window here</strong> from the context menu.</p>
